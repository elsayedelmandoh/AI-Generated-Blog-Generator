# AI-Generated Blog Posts with Images

Developed a Streamlit app generates a blog post using AI models from Hugging Face. Users input a blog title, and the app creates an Introduction, Body, and Conclusion based on that title. It uses a text generation model to create the content and an image generation model to create the images.

## Project Objectives

The project utilizes Streamlit for building a user-friendly interface to interact with the AI-generated blog post generator and data for text and image generation is acquired through Hugging Face APIs.
- **Keyword Selection:** Specify relevant keywords related to your chosen topic.
- **Text Generation:** Use generative models to create the blog post content based on input keywords.
- **Image Generation:** Utilize image generative models to generate images based on descriptions or keywords.
- **Blog Post Formatting:** Format the generated text and images into a coherent structure, including an introduction, body, and conclusion.
- **Image Integration:** Explain the process of integrating generated images into the blog post.

## Usage

To run the application:

1. Install the required packages:
    ```
    pip install streamlit pillow requests
    ```

2. Execute the following command:
    ```
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

3. Enter the title and follow the instructions on the Streamlit app to generate and preview the AI-generated blog post.
